# Tutorials

Welcome to my collection of various tutorials, examples and documents, especially regarding Linux and kernel. Still a work in progress!

## Kernel module examples

You will find a variety of kernel module examples, each exposing some part of kernel API. Each kernel module has a Makefile with following commands:

|   command    |    action     |
|--------------|---------------|
| `make`       | build         |
| `make start` | start module  |
| `make stop`  | stop module   |
| `make clean` | clean         |
